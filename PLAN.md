# Kinnect Implementation Plan

## Overview
Building a polished, private Instagram-style iOS app from scratch. The plan is structured in phases, each delivering a functional milestone. We'll build the foundation first, then layer features incrementally.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Project Setup
**Goal:** Set up the development environment and project architecture

### Tasks:
1. **Xcode Project Structure**
   - Create organized folder structure (Models, Views, ViewModels, Services, Utilities, Resources)
   - Set up MVVM architecture foundation
   - Configure build settings and app capabilities

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Add Swift Package Manager dependencies:
     - Supabase Swift SDK
     - Any image processing libraries (if needed)
   - Create `Secrets.plist` for configuration (gitignored)

3. **Supabase Backend Setup**
   - Create Supabase project
   - Set up database schema (see Phase 1b below)
   - Configure authentication providers (Sign in with Apple)
   - Create storage buckets for media (private)
   - Set up Row-Level Security (RLS) policies

4. **Core Services Layer**
   - `SupabaseService` – singleton for Supabase client configuration
   - `AuthService` – authentication operations
   - `NetworkService` – base networking utilities
   - Environment configuration manager

**Deliverable:** Project skeleton with Supabase connected, no UI yet

---

## Phase 1b: Database Schema & RLS
**Goal:** Establish the complete database foundation

### Tables to Create:
```sql
-- User profiles
profiles (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users,
  username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  full_name TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
)

-- Following relationships
follows (
  follower UUID REFERENCES profiles(user_id),
  followee UUID REFERENCES profiles(user_id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  PRIMARY KEY (follower, followee)
)

-- Posts
posts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  author UUID REFERENCES profiles(user_id),
  caption TEXT,
  media_key TEXT NOT NULL,  -- Supabase Storage object path
  media_type TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'photo' or 'video'
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
)

-- Likes
likes (
  post_id UUID REFERENCES posts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(user_id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  PRIMARY KEY (post_id, user_id)
)

-- Comments
comments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  post_id UUID REFERENCES posts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(user_id),
  body TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

### Row-Level Security Policies:
- Users can read their own profile and profiles of people they follow
- Users can only create posts for themselves
- Users can only read posts from themselves or people they follow
- Users can like/comment on posts they can read

### Storage Buckets:
- `avatars` (private, signed URLs)
- `posts` (private, signed URLs)

- **Saved posts** (bookmark feature)
- **Reporting & moderation tools**

---

## Recommended Tech Decisions

### Edge Functions (Minimal Use)
1. **Image Compression** ✅ Essential – reduces storage costs and improves performance
2. **Push Notifications** ✅ Essential – requires server-side APNs integration
3. **User Moderation** ✅ Optional – admin operations (ban, delete content)

Avoid edge functions for standard CRUD operations – use RLS policies instead.

- **Real-time validation** for username
- **Instagram-style UI** throughout
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Follow button** (UI only - will be functional in Phase 8)
- **Cache-busting** for avatar URLs to prevent image caching issues

#### Important Learnings - Supabase Storage & RLS

**Storage File Organization:**
Files should be stored in user-specific folders:
- ✅ **Correct**: `{userId}/{fileName}.jpg` (e.g., `abc123/abc123.jpg`)
- ❌ **Incorrect**: `{fileName}.jpg` at root

**RLS Policy Patterns for Storage:**

For a private app with authenticated users only, use this simple pattern:
```sql
-- INSERT: Allow authenticated users to upload to bucket
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- UPDATE/DELETE: Only file owners can modify
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own files"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND owner = auth.uid());
```

**Why folder-based restrictions failed:**
- `storage.foldername(name)` and regex-based checks had issues with UUID string matching
- The `owner` field (set automatically by Supabase) is more reliable for UPDATE/DELETE
- For INSERT, trusting authenticated users + app-level folder organization works well

**Cache-Busting for Images:**
When using the same filename (e.g., `userId.jpg`), add a timestamp to force cache refresh:
```swift
let cacheBustedURL = publicURL.absoluteString + "?t=\(Int(Date().timeIntervalSince1970))"
```

**Date Decoding Fix:**
Supabase returns dates as ISO 8601 strings. Configure JSONDecoder:
```swift
let decoder = JSONDecoder()
decoder.dateDecodingStrategy = .iso8601
```

**Supabase SDK API Changes:**
- ❌ Old: `client.database.from("table")`
- ✅ New: `client.from("table")`

#### Testing Results
- ✅ Profile loading works perfectly
- ✅ Edit profile updates username, full name, and bio
- ✅ Avatar upload with compression (handles images > 2MB)
- ✅ Avatar updates immediately (cache-busting working)
- ✅ Stats display correctly (0 posts, 0 followers, 0 following)
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh works
- ✅ Logout functionality works
- ✅ Username validation prevents invalid characters
- ✅ All views match Instagram design language

**Phase 3 Status: ✅ COMPLETE**

---

### ✅ Phase 4: Feed UI Foundation – COMPLETE

**Completed:** October 22, 2025

**What We Built:**

#### Components Created

**PostCellView.swift** - Instagram-style post cell with:
- ✅ Header section: circular avatar, username, three-dot menu
- ✅ Square 1:1 aspect ratio image container
- ✅ Action buttons: like, comment, share, bookmark (Instagram layout)
- ✅ Like count display
- ✅ Caption with username (bold) + text that wraps naturally (Instagram style)
- ✅ Caption truncation at ~100 characters with "more" button
- ✅ "View all X comments" link (when comments exist)
- ✅ Relative timestamp (e.g., "2H AGO")
- ✅ Interactive like button (toggles red, updates count)
- ✅ Expandable captions on tap

**FeedView.swift** - Main feed screen with:
- ✅ Scrollable feed using LazyVStack for performance
- ✅ Empty state: "No posts yet. Follow people to see their posts"
- ✅ Mock data with 2 sample posts for UI preview
- ✅ Smooth scrolling with hidden scroll indicators
- ✅ Dividers between posts
- ✅ Loads mock data on appear

**Post.swift Model Updates:**
- ✅ Custom initializer for creating posts manually
- ✅ Decodable initializer (`init(from decoder:)`) for Codable conformance
- ✅ Mutable relationship properties (authorProfile, likeCount, commentCount, isLikedByCurrentUser)

#### Key Design Decisions

**No Pull-to-Refresh:**
- Removed for small private network (5-20 users)
- Feed loads fresh data on app launch/tab switch (Phase 6)
- Real-time updates will auto-update feed in Phase 9
- Simpler UX appropriate for intimate network

**Caption Layout:**
- Uses Text concatenation (not HStack) for natural text flow
- Username (bold) + caption text wrap together like Instagram
- "more" button for truncated captions expands on tap

**Placeholder Images:**
- Using external URLs (picsum.photos, pravatar.cc) for Phase 4 preview
- Will be replaced with Supabase Storage signed URLs in Phase 6

#### Testing Results
- ✅ Feed displays 2 sample posts with realistic content
- ✅ Images load correctly (avatars + post images)
- ✅ Like button toggles and updates count optimistically
- ✅ Caption expansion works on tap
- ✅ All UI matches Instagram design language
- ✅ Smooth scrolling performance
- ✅ Empty state displays when no posts
- ✅ All 5 tabs navigate correctly

#### Important Learnings

**Text Concatenation for Captions:**
Using `+` operator to combine Text views creates natural wrapping:
```swift
Text(username).bold() + Text(" ") + Text(caption)
```
Better than HStack which keeps elements side-by-side.

**LazyVStack for Performance:**
- Only renders visible cells
- Essential for large feeds in production
- Enables smooth scrolling

**Codable with Custom Initializers:**
When adding custom `init()`, must manually implement `init(from decoder:)` to maintain Codable conformance.

**Phase 4 Status: ✅ COMPLETE**

- caption (TEXT, nullable)
- media_key (TEXT, storage path)
- media_type (TEXT, 'photo')
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)

#### Issues Encountered & Solutions

**Issue 1: RLS Policy Blocking Uploads**
- **Problem:** Storage upload failed with "new row violates row-level security policy"
- **Root Cause:** Complex folder-based RLS policy with UUID string matching failures
- **Solution:** Simplified to same pattern as Phase 3 avatars bucket:
  ```sql
  CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload posts"
  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'posts');
  ```
- **Lesson:** Keep storage RLS policies simple for authenticated-only apps

**Issue 2: UUID Type Mismatch**
- **Problem:** Database insert failed RLS check `auth.uid() = author`
- **Root Cause:** Sending author as String instead of UUID
- **Solution:** Changed `NewPost` struct to use UUID types directly
- **Lesson:** Match Swift types to Postgres column types exactly

**Issue 3: Upload Timeout (Simulator)**
- **Problem:** 1.8 MB uploads timing out on simulator
- **Root Cause:** iOS Simulator network throttling and QUIC protocol issues
- **Solution:**
  - Reduced compression: 1200px → 1080px
  - Lower target: 2MB → 1MB
  - Lower quality: 0.8 → 0.7
  - **Result:** ~739 KB files (but still timing out on simulator)
- **Status:** ⚠️ Pending physical device testing
- **Expected:** Should work perfectly on real device with real network

#### Key Design Decisions

**No Edge Functions:**
- Supabase has built-in image transformation (on-the-fly resizing/optimization)
- Client-side compression sufficient for upload size management
- Keeps architecture simple

**PHPicker vs Custom Picker:**
- Using native PHPickerViewController
- No Info.plist permissions needed (system-level privacy)
- Single photo selection only (Phase 5 scope)
- Can enhance with custom picker later if needed

**Sequential Upload:**
- Upload image first → Get storage path → Create database record
- Prevents orphaned database records if upload fails
- Matches Instagram's approach

**Simple Progress Indicator:**
- "Posting..." overlay with spinner
- No percentage or background uploads (Phase 5 scope)
- Can enhance in polish phase if needed

#### Testing Status

**✅ Tested on Simulator:**
- Photo picker works perfectly
- Caption entry works
- Image compression works (739 KB achieved)
- RLS policies fixed
- Database structure verified

**⚠️ Pending Physical Device Test:**
- Upload timeout on simulator (network throttling)
- Expected to work on real device with actual WiFi/cellular
- 739 KB should upload in 2-3 seconds on real network

**✅ Verified in Supabase Dashboard:**
- Storage bucket structure correct
- RLS policies working
- Database schema ready

#### Important Learnings

**Image Compression Strategy:**
- Target 1080px matches Instagram standard
- Sub-1MB files upload quickly even on slower connections
- Adaptive quality (0.7 → 0.1) ensures size limits met
- SwiftUI's UIGraphicsImageRenderer efficient for resizing

**Simulator Network Limitations:**
- Simulator is unreliable for upload testing
- QUIC protocol issues common
- Always test network operations on physical device
- Even small files can timeout on simulator

**Storage RLS Pattern:**
- Simple is better: `bucket_id = 'posts'` for authenticated users
- Avoid complex folder name parsing with UUIDs
- Trust app-level organization (user folders)
- Use `owner` field for UPDATE/DELETE policies

**Phase 5 Status: ✅ COMPLETE**

**Testing Results (iPhone 14):**
- ✅ Photo picker works perfectly
- ✅ Image compression works (742 KB achieved)
- ✅ Upload to Supabase Storage successful
- ✅ Post record creation successful
- ✅ Date decoding issue fixed with custom JSONDecoder.supabase
- ✅ Profile loading working
- ✅ End-to-end post creation flow complete

**Important Fix Applied:**
Created `JSONDecoder+Supabase.swift` extension to handle Supabase's ISO8601 dates with fractional seconds (e.g., `2024-10-22T12:34:56.789123+00:00`). This fixed both profile loading and post creation errors.
