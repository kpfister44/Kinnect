# Post Menu Actions (Delete & Unfollow)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **Complete**
**Completed:** October 27, 2025
**Feature:** Three-dot menu in PostCellView with context-aware actions

---

## Overview

Instagram-style three-dot menu with context-aware actions:
- **Own posts:** Delete post option (removes from database + storage)
- **Other users' posts:** Unfollow user option (removes all their posts from feed)

This provides essential post management and user control features for the Kinnect MVP.

---

## Design Decisions

### User Experience

**Three-Dot Menu Behavior:**
- Tapping the three-dot button (ellipsis) opens a **confirmation dialog** (SwiftUI Alert)
- Different options based on post ownership:
  - **Own post:** "Delete Post" (destructive action, red text)
  - **Other's post:** "Unfollow [username]" (destructive action, red text)
- Both dialogs include a "Cancel" option

**Why Alert Instead of Sheet?**
- Instagram uses bottom sheets, but SwiftUI's `.confirmationDialog()` is native and simple
- Single action per menu (not multiple options) works well with alerts
- Consistent with iOS patterns for destructive actions
- Future enhancement: Can upgrade to custom bottom sheet if more options are added

### Technical Approach

**Optimistic UI Pattern** (used throughout Kinnect):
1. Show confirmation dialog
2. If confirmed, update UI **immediately** (remove post from feed)
3. Execute API call in background
4. On **success**: Keep UI state
5. On **error**: Rollback (restore post to feed), show error alert

**Benefits:**
- Instant visual feedback
- App feels responsive even on slow networks
- Graceful error recovery
- Consistent with existing patterns (likes, follows, comments)

## Architecture

### Service Layer

#### PostService.swift (NEW METHOD)

Add deletion capability to existing `PostService`:

```swift
// MARK: - Post Deletion

/// Delete a post (database record + storage file)
/// - Parameters:
///   - postId: The post ID to delete
///   - userId: The current user's ID (for authorization check)
///   - mediaKey: The storage path for the media file
/// - Throws: PostServiceError if deletion fails
func deletePost(postId: UUID, userId: UUID, mediaKey: String) async throws {
    print("üóëÔ∏è Deleting post: \(postId)")

    // Step 1: Delete from database (also deletes likes/comments via CASCADE)
    try await deletePostRecord(postId: postId, userId: userId)
    print("‚úÖ Post record deleted from database")

    // Step 2: Delete from storage bucket
    try await deletePostMedia(mediaKey: mediaKey)
    print("‚úÖ Post media deleted from storage")

    print("‚úÖ Post deleted successfully")
}

private func deletePostRecord(postId: UUID, userId: UUID) async throws {
    do {
        try await client
            .from("posts")
            .delete()
            .eq("id", value: postId.uuidString)
            .eq("author", value: userId.uuidString) // RLS check
            .execute()
    } catch {
        print("‚ùå Database delete failed: \(error)")
        throw PostServiceError.deleteFailed(error)
    }
}

private func deletePostMedia(mediaKey: String) async throws {
    do {
        try await client.storage
            .from("posts")
            .remove(paths: [mediaKey])
    } catch {
        print("‚ùå Storage delete failed: \(error)")
        // Non-fatal: database record is already deleted
        // Storage cleanup can be done later via admin tools
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è Continuing despite storage error")
    }
}
```

**Error Handling:**
Add new error case to `PostServiceError`:
```swift
case deleteFailed(Error)

// Error description:
case .deleteFailed(let error):
    return "Failed to delete post: \(error.localizedDescription)"
```

**RLS Security:**
- Database RLS policy ensures users can only delete their own posts
- `.eq("author", value: userId.uuidString)` ensures server-side check
- If user tries to delete someone else's post, Supabase returns error

#### FollowService.swift (EXISTING)

Already has `unfollowUser` method (from Phase 8):
```swift
func unfollowUser(followerId: UUID, followeeId: UUID) async throws
```

No changes needed - just use existing method.

---

### ViewModel Layer

#### FeedViewModel.swift (NEW METHOD)

Add post deletion with optimistic UI:

```swift
// MARK: - Post Actions

/// Delete a post (optimistic UI)
func deletePost(_ post: Post) async {
    print("üóëÔ∏è Initiating post deletion: \(post.id)")

    // Step 1: Store original state for rollback
    let originalPosts = posts
    let postIndex = posts.firstIndex(where: { $0.id == post.id })

    // Step 2: Optimistic update - remove from UI immediately
    posts.removeAll(where: { $0.id == post.id })
    print("‚úÖ Post removed from UI")

    // Step 3: Execute API call in background
    do {
        try await PostService.shared.deletePost(
            postId: post.id,
            userId: currentUserId,
            mediaKey: post.mediaKey
        )
        print("‚úÖ Post deletion successful")
        // Keep UI state (post already removed)

    } catch {
        print("‚ùå Post deletion failed: \(error)")

        // Step 4: Rollback on error
        posts = originalPosts
        errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
        print("üîÑ Rolled back post deletion")
    }
}

/// Unfollow post author and remove their posts from feed
func unfollowPostAuthor(_ post: Post) async {
    guard let authorId = post.author else {
        print("‚ùå Cannot unfollow: post has no author")
        return
    }

    guard let authorUsername = post.authorProfile?.username else {
        print("‚ùå Cannot unfollow: post has no author profile")
        return
    }

    print("üë• Unfollowing user: \(authorUsername)")

    // Step 1: Store original state for rollback
    let originalPosts = posts

    // Step 2: Optimistic update - remove all posts from this author
    posts.removeAll(where: { $0.author == authorId })
    print("‚úÖ Removed \(authorUsername)'s posts from feed")

    // Step 3: Execute API call in background
    do {
        try await FollowService.shared.unfollowUser(
            followerId: currentUserId,
            followeeId: authorId
        )
        print("‚úÖ Unfollowed \(authorUsername)")
        // Keep UI state (posts already removed)

        // Step 4: Update followedUserIds for realtime filtering
        followedUserIds.removeAll(where: { $0 == authorId })

    } catch {
        print("‚ùå Unfollow failed: \(error)")

        // Step 5: Rollback on error
        posts = originalPosts
        errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
        print("üîÑ Rolled back unfollow")
    }
}
```

**Key Design Notes:**
- Uses same optimistic UI pattern as `toggleLike()` (existing code)
- Stores original posts array for rollback on error
- `unfollowPostAuthor` removes ALL posts from that user (Instagram behavior)
- Updates `followedUserIds` to prevent realtime posts from unfollowed users

### View Layer

#### PostCellView.swift (MODIFICATIONS)

Add state and confirmation dialogs:

```swift
struct PostCellView: View {
    let post: Post
    var mediaURL: URL?
    @EnvironmentObject var feedViewModel: FeedViewModel

    @State private var isExpanded = false
    @State private var showingComments = false
    @State private var showDeleteConfirmation = false  // NEW
    @State private var showUnfollowConfirmation = false  // NEW

    // ... existing code ...

    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 0) {
            headerView
            imageView
            actionButtonsView
            // ... rest of content ...
        }
        .background(Color.igBackground)
        .sheet(isPresented: $showingComments) {
            // ... existing comments sheet ...
        }
        // NEW: Delete confirmation
        .alert("Delete Post?", isPresented: $showDeleteConfirmation) {
            Button("Cancel", role: .cancel) { }
            Button("Delete", role: .destructive) {
                Task {
                    await feedViewModel.deletePost(post)
                }
            }
        } message: {
            Text("This post will be permanently deleted.")
        }
        // NEW: Unfollow confirmation
        .alert("Unfollow \(post.authorProfile?.username ?? "User")?", isPresented: $showUnfollowConfirmation) {
            Button("Cancel", role: .cancel) { }
            Button("Unfollow", role: .destructive) {
                Task {
                    await feedViewModel.unfollowPostAuthor(post)
                }
            }
        } message: {
            Text("Their posts will no longer appear in your feed.")
        }
    }

    // MODIFIED: headerView with functional three-dot menu
    private var headerView: some View {
        HStack(spacing: 12) {
            // Avatar
            if let avatarUrl = post.authorProfile?.avatarUrl {
                AsyncImage(url: URL(string: avatarUrl)) { image in
                    image.resizable().aspectRatio(contentMode: .fill)
                } placeholder: {
                    Circle().fill(Color.igSeparator)
                }
                .frame(width: 32, height: 32)
                .clipShape(Circle())
            } else {
                Circle()
                    .fill(Color.igSeparator)
                    .frame(width: 32, height: 32)
                    .overlay(
                        Image(systemName: "person.fill")
                            .font(.system(size: 14))
                            .foregroundColor(.igTextSecondary)
                    )
            }

            // Username
            Text(post.authorProfile?.username ?? "Unknown")
                .font(.system(size: 14, weight: .semibold))
                .foregroundColor(.igTextPrimary)

            Spacer()

            // Three-dot menu (MODIFIED)
            Button {
                handleThreeDotMenuTap()
            } label: {
                Image(systemName: "ellipsis")
                    .font(.system(size: 16, weight: .semibold))
                    .foregroundColor(.igTextPrimary)
                    .frame(width: 44, height: 44)
            }
        }
        .padding(.horizontal, 12)
        .padding(.vertical, 8)
    }

    // NEW: Handle three-dot menu tap
    private func handleThreeDotMenuTap() {
        // Check if this is the current user's post
        let isOwnPost = post.author == feedViewModel.currentUserId

        if isOwnPost {
            showDeleteConfirmation = true
        } else {
            showUnfollowConfirmation = true
        }
    }
}
```

**UI Details:**
- **Delete alert:**
  - Title: "Delete Post?"
  - Message: "This post will be permanently deleted."
  - Buttons: "Cancel" (gray) + "Delete" (red, destructive)

- **Unfollow alert:**
  - Title: "Unfollow [username]?"
  - Message: "Their posts will no longer appear in your feed."
  - Buttons: "Cancel" (gray) + "Unfollow" (red, destructive)

## Database Considerations

### Cascade Deletes

When a post is deleted from the `posts` table, the following are **automatically deleted** via `ON DELETE CASCADE`:

1. **Likes** - All likes on the post (from `likes` table)
2. **Comments** - All comments on the post (from `comments` table)
3. **Activities** - All activities related to the post (from `activities` table)

**Migration Check:** Verify activities table has CASCADE:
```sql
-- From ACTIVITY_SYSTEM.md (already implemented)
post_id UUID REFERENCES posts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
```

‚úÖ All related data is cleaned up automatically - no manual deletion needed.

### Storage Cleanup

**Storage deletion is attempted but non-fatal:**
- If storage delete fails (network issue, etc.), database record is already gone
- Orphaned files can be cleaned up later via admin tools or cron job
- This prevents partial failures from blocking the user

---

## Testing Plan

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Delete Post (Own Post)
- [ ] Tap three-dot menu on own post
- [ ] "Delete Post?" alert appears
- [ ] Tap "Cancel" ‚Üí Alert dismisses, post remains
- [ ] Tap "Delete" ‚Üí Post disappears from feed immediately
- [ ] Post is deleted from database (check Supabase)
- [ ] Media file is deleted from storage (check Supabase Storage)
- [ ] Likes/comments/activities are cascade-deleted
- [ ] Test error handling: Simulate network failure, verify rollback

#### Unfollow User (Other's Post)
- [ ] Tap three-dot menu on another user's post
- [ ] "Unfollow [username]?" alert appears
- [ ] Tap "Cancel" ‚Üí Alert dismisses, post remains
- [ ] Tap "Unfollow" ‚Üí All posts from that user disappear immediately
- [ ] User is unfollowed in database (check follows table)
- [ ] New posts from unfollowed user don't appear in realtime
- [ ] Visit unfollowed user's profile ‚Üí "Follow" button shows
- [ ] Test error handling: Simulate network failure, verify rollback

#### Edge Cases
- [ ] Delete post with 100+ likes/comments (cascade performance)
- [ ] Unfollow user with 20+ posts in feed (all removed)
- [ ] Tap three-dot menu rapidly (debounce)
- [ ] Delete post while offline ‚Üí Error message shown
- [ ] Attempt to delete someone else's post (should fail server-side)

### Security Testing

- [ ] **RLS Policy Test:** Try to delete another user's post via API
  - Expected: Supabase returns 403/401 error
  - UI should show error message

- [ ] **Storage Access Test:** Try to delete another user's media file
  - Expected: Storage RLS blocks unauthorized deletion

## Error Handling

### PostService Errors

```swift
enum PostServiceError: LocalizedError {
    case imageCompressionFailed
    case uploadFailed(Error)
    case databaseError(Error)
    case deleteFailed(Error)  // NEW

    var errorDescription: String? {
        switch self {
        case .deleteFailed(let error):
            return "Failed to delete post: \(error.localizedDescription)"
        // ... existing cases ...
        }
    }
}
```

### User-Facing Error Messages

**Delete Post Failed:**
- "Failed to delete post: [error]"
- Post is restored to feed (optimistic rollback)
- User can retry by tapping three-dot menu again

**Unfollow Failed:**
- "Failed to unfollow user: [error]"
- Posts are restored to feed (optimistic rollback)
- User can retry by tapping three-dot menu again

---

## Implementation Summary

### Service Layer (PostService.swift)
**Added Methods:**
- `deletePost(postId:userId:mediaKey:)` - Deletes post from database and storage
- `deletePostRecord(postId:userId:)` - Private method for database deletion with RLS check
- `deletePostMedia(mediaKey:)` - Private method for storage deletion (non-fatal)

**Error Handling:**
- Added `PostServiceError.deleteFailed(Error)` case
- Storage deletion failures are logged but non-fatal (database record already deleted)

### ViewModel Layer

**FeedViewModel.swift:**
- `deletePost(_ post:)` - Optimistic UI deletion with rollback
- `unfollowPostAuthor(_ post:)` - Optimistic UI unfollow with rollback
- Added `PostService` and `FollowService` dependencies
- Uses actor isolation pattern (optional parameters with nil-coalescing)

**Key Pattern:** Optimistic UI
1. Store original state
2. Update UI immediately
3. Execute API call
4. Rollback on error

### View Layer

**PostCellView.swift (Feed Tab):**
- Added `@State` vars for confirmation dialogs
- Added delete/unfollow confirmation alerts
- Implemented `handleThreeDotMenuTap()` - shows context-aware menu
- Three-dot menu button now functional

**PostDetailView.swift (Profile Grid):**
- Same delete/unfollow functionality as PostCellView
- Auto-dismisses after successful delete/unfollow
- Removed share and bookmark buttons (not in MVP)

**ProfileView.swift:**
- Auto-refreshes when navigating back from detail view
- `.task` modifier handles profile reload
- Post count updates correctly after deletion

---

## Testing Results

‚úÖ **Delete Post (Own Post):**
- Three-dot menu on own post shows "Delete Post?" alert
- Cancel dismisses alert, post remains
- Delete removes post immediately from UI (feed and profile grid)
- Post deleted from database (verified via logs)
- Media file deleted from storage (verified via logs)
- Likes/comments/activities cascade-deleted automatically
- Profile grid refreshes with correct post count

‚úÖ **Unfollow User (Other's Post):**
- Three-dot menu on other user's post shows "Unfollow [username]?" alert
- Cancel dismisses alert, post remains
- Unfollow removes all posts from that user immediately
- User unfollowed in database
- Profile shows "Follow" button after unfollow
- Realtime posts from unfollowed user don't appear

‚úÖ **Both Views Working:**
- Feed tab: Uses FeedViewModel with optimistic UI
- Profile detail view: Uses PostDetailView, auto-dismisses after action
- Consistent UX across both entry points

‚úÖ **Edge Cases:**
- Network errors show error message and rollback
- RLS policies prevent unauthorized deletions (server-side)
- Storage deletion failures are non-fatal (database record already deleted)
- Post count updates correctly after deletion

### Bug Fixes During Implementation

**Actor Isolation Error:**
- **Problem:** Can't reference `@MainActor` static `.shared` properties in default parameters
- **Solution:** Use optional parameters with nil-coalescing in initializer body
- **Pattern:** `init(service: Service? = nil) { self.service = service ?? .shared }`

**Optional Binding Error:**
- **Problem:** `post.author` is non-optional UUID, can't use `guard let`
- **Solution:** Direct assignment `let authorId = post.author`

**Profile Grid Not Updating:**
- **Problem:** Grid showed stale data after deleting from detail view
- **Solution:** ProfileView's `.task` modifier already handles refresh on navigation return
- **Result:** Post count decrements correctly (6 ‚Üí 5 posts in logs)

## Future Enhancements (Not in MVP Scope)

- Report Post (for community moderation)
- Hide Post (remove from feed without unfollowing)
- Edit Post Caption (modify existing post)
- Share to Other Apps (iOS share sheet)
- Copy Link (post URL)
- Turn Off Comments (disable commenting on post)
- Archive Post (hide from profile, not delete)
- Block User (prevent all interactions)
