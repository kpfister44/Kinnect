# Activity System (Notifications)

**Status:** ‚úÖ **Complete** (Fully tested and working)
**Completed:** October 27, 2025
**Phase:** Phase 9.5 (Activity Tab)

---

## Overview

Complete Instagram-style activity/notification system showing likes, comments, and follows. Features include:
- Automatic activity creation via database triggers
- Activity grouping (multiple likes on same post)
- Real-time activity notifications
- Badge count on tab bar
- Mark as read functionality
- Navigation to profiles (profile navigation working, post navigation pending)

---

## Architecture

### Database Layer

**Table: `activities`**
```sql
CREATE TABLE activities (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,  -- recipient
  actor_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES profiles(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,  -- who did it
  activity_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (activity_type IN ('like', 'comment', 'follow')),
  post_id UUID REFERENCES posts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,  -- for likes/comments
  comment_id UUID REFERENCES comments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,  -- for comments
  is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()  -- IMPORTANT: TIMESTAMPTZ for proper ISO8601
);
```

**Indexes:**
- `idx_activities_user_id` - Fast user lookups
- `idx_activities_created_at` - Chronological ordering
- `idx_activities_is_read` - Unread count queries

**RLS Policies:**
- Users can only view/update/delete their own activities
- No INSERT policy (activities created via triggers only)

**Database Triggers:**
- `on_like_created` ‚Üí `create_like_activity()` - Auto-create activity when someone likes your post
- `on_comment_created` ‚Üí `create_comment_activity()` - Auto-create activity when someone comments
- `on_follow_created` ‚Üí `create_follow_activity()` - Auto-create activity when someone follows you
- `on_like_deleted` ‚Üí `delete_like_activity()` - Cleanup on unlike
- `on_comment_deleted` ‚Üí `delete_comment_activity()` - Cleanup on comment delete
- `on_follow_deleted` ‚Üí `delete_follow_activity()` - Cleanup on unfollow

**Key Design Decision:** All triggers use `SECURITY DEFINER SET search_path = public` to pass security advisors.

---

## Swift Implementation

### Models

**`/Models/Activity.swift`**
```swift
enum ActivityType: String, Codable {
    case like
    case comment
    case follow
}

struct Activity: Codable, Identifiable, Equatable {
    let id: UUID
    let userId: UUID           // recipient
    let actorId: UUID          // performer
    let activityType: ActivityType
    let postId: UUID?
    let commentId: UUID?
    let isRead: Bool
    let createdAt: Date
    var actorProfile: Profile? // populated via joins
}

struct GroupedActivityItem: Identifiable, Equatable {
    let id: UUID
    let activityType: ActivityType
    let postId: UUID?
    let commentId: UUID?
    let isRead: Bool
    let createdAt: Date
    let activities: [Activity]  // underlying activities

    var actors: [Profile]       // all actors in group
    var primaryActor: Profile?  // first actor
    var isGrouped: Bool         // multiple activities
}
```

---

### Services

**`/Services/ActivityService.swift`**

```swift
final class ActivityService {
    static let shared = ActivityService()

    // Fetch activities for user (last 30 days)
    func fetchActivities(userId: UUID) async throws -> [Activity]

    // Get unread count for badge
    func getUnreadCount(userId: UUID) async throws -> Int

    // Mark individual activity as read
    func markAsRead(activityId: UUID) async throws

    // Mark all activities as read
    func markAllAsRead(userId: UUID) async throws

    // Delete single activity
    func deleteActivity(activityId: UUID, userId: UUID) async throws

    // Clear all activities
    func clearAllActivities(userId: UUID) async throws
}
```

**Key Details:**
- Fetches activities with actor profiles via JOIN
- Returns last 30 days only (prevents unbounded growth)
- Uses `.select()` with nested profile data

---

**`/Services/RealtimeService.swift` (Extended)**

Added activity subscription methods:
```swift
func createActivityChannel(userId: UUID) -> RealtimeChannelV2
func subscribeToActivityInserts(channel: RealtimeChannelV2) async -> some AsyncSequence
```

**Activity Event Model:**
```swift
struct RealtimeActivityInsert: Decodable {
    let id: UUID
    let userId: UUID
    let actorId: UUID
    let activityType: String
    let postId: UUID?
    let commentId: UUID?
    let isRead: Bool
    let createdAt: Date
}
```

---

### ViewModels

**`/ViewModels/ActivityViewModel.swift`**

```swift
@MainActor
final class ActivityViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var activities: [Activity] = []
    @Published var groupedActivities: [GroupedActivityItem] = []
    @Published var state: LoadingState = .idle
    @Published var errorMessage: String?
    @Published var unreadCount: Int = 0

    private var realtimeChannel: RealtimeChannelV2?

    // Load activities
    func loadActivities() async
    func refreshActivities() async

    // Unread count management
    func updateUnreadCount() async

    // Mark as read (single activity)
    func markAsRead(_ activity: Activity) async

    // Mark as read (all activities in grouped item) ‚úÖ FIXED
    func markGroupedActivityAsRead(_ groupedItem: GroupedActivityItem) async

    // Mark all as read
    func markAllAsRead() async

    // Delete operations
    func deleteActivity(_ groupedItem: GroupedActivityItem) async
    func clearAllActivities() async

    // Realtime subscriptions
    func setupRealtimeSubscriptions() async
    func cleanupRealtimeSubscriptions() async

    // Grouping logic
    private func groupActivities(_ activities: [Activity]) -> [GroupedActivityItem]
}
```

**Grouping Logic:**
- **Likes on same post:** Grouped into single item with multiple actors
- **Comments:** Always individual (not grouped)
- **Follows:** Always individual (not grouped)

**Optimistic Updates:**
- Immediate UI updates for mark as read, delete
- Background API calls
- Rollback on error

---

### Views

**`/Views/Activity/ActivityView.swift`**

Main activity screen with:
- Empty state: "No Activity Yet"
- Error state with retry button
- Activities list with pull-to-refresh
- Swipe-to-delete on individual rows
- "Mark all read" button (top right, when unread > 0)
- Navigation to profiles via `NavigationPath`

**Navigation:**
```swift
.navigationDestination(for: UUID.self) { userId in
    ProfileView(userId: userId)
}
```

**Activity Tap Behavior:**
- Marks all activities in group as read
- Navigates to actor's profile
- TODO: Navigate to PostDetailView for likes/comments

---

**`/Views/Activity/ActivityRowView.swift`**

Individual activity row with:
- Single or stacked avatars (for grouped likes)
- Activity text (dynamic based on type)
- Relative timestamp ("5s", "2m", "3h", "2d")
- Blue dot indicator for unread
- Tap handler

**Activity Text Formatting:**
- **Single like:** "username liked your photo."
- **Grouped likes (2):** "username and username2 liked your photo."
- **Grouped likes (3+):** "username and 2 others liked your photo."
- **Comment:** "username commented: ..."
- **Follow:** "username started following you."

---

**`/Views/Shared/TabBarView.swift` (Modified)**

Added badge count on Activity tab:
```swift
.badge(activityViewModel.unreadCount > 0 ? Text("\(activityViewModel.unreadCount)") : Text(""))
```

**Key Detail:** Uses `Text` type for both branches to match `.badge()` overload signature.

---

**`/Views/Profile/ProfileView.swift` (Modified)**

Fixed nested NavigationStack issue:
```swift
var body: some View {
    Group {
        if userId == nil {
            // Root view in tab bar - needs NavigationStack
            NavigationStack {
                profileContent
            }
        } else {
            // Navigation destination - don't create nested NavigationStack
            profileContent
        }
    }
}
```

**Why:** Prevents "No matching navigationDestination" error when navigating from ActivityView.

## Known Issues üêõ

### 1. Grouped Activity Mark-as-Read Bug ‚úÖ FIXED (Oct 26, Tested Oct 27)
**Problem:** Only first activity in group marked as read, blue dot persisted
**Solution:** Created `markGroupedActivityAsRead()` to mark all activities in group
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed and tested - working perfectly

### 2. Nested NavigationStack Bug ‚úÖ FIXED (Oct 26, Tested Oct 27)
**Problem:** ProfileView created nested NavigationStack, breaking navigation
**Solution:** Conditional NavigationStack creation based on userId (root vs destination)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed and tested - navigation working correctly

### 3. Badge Display Bug ‚úÖ FIXED (Oct 27)
**Problem:** Red badge circle appeared even when unread count was 0
**Solution:** Changed from `.badge(Text(""))` to `.badge(Text?)` with nil when count = 0
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed - badge now disappears completely when no unread activities

### 4. Comment Body Not Displayed
**Problem:** ActivityRowView shows "..." for comments instead of actual comment text
**Reason:** Comment body not included in activity data
**Solution Options:**
  - A) Store comment body in activities table (denormalized)
  - B) Join comments table in fetchActivities query
  - C) Accept "..." as placeholder (current)
**Status:** Deferred (low priority)

### 5. Post Navigation Not Implemented
**Problem:** Tapping like/comment activity navigates to profile, not post
**Reason:** Would need to fetch Post data and navigate to PostDetailView
**Solution:** Fetch post by postId and use navigation to PostDetailView
**Status:** TODO - Low priority (profile navigation is acceptable)

### 6. Timestamp Format Issue ‚úÖ FIXED (Oct 26)
**Problem:** Initial activities had TIMESTAMP instead of TIMESTAMPTZ
**Solution:** Migration to convert created_at to TIMESTAMPTZ
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed

---

## Testing Status üß™

### ‚úÖ Fully Tested (Oct 27, 2025)
1. **Empty state** - Shows correctly when no activities
2. **Activity creation** - Database triggers fire correctly
3. **Real-time badge updates** - Badge increments immediately when new activities arrive
4. **Activity grouping** - Grouped likes display correctly ("bob_builder and 2 others")
5. **"Mark all read" button** - Successfully marks all as read
6. **Mark grouped activity as read** - All activities in group marked (blue dots disappear)
7. **Navigation to profiles** - Tapping activities navigates to correct user's profile
8. **Timestamps** - Display correctly in relative format ("1d", "2h", etc.)
9. **Badge visibility** - Badge appears with count when unread > 0, disappears when 0
10. **Badge count accuracy** - Decrements correctly when activities marked as read

### üü° Partially Tested
1. **Activity cleanup** - Unlike/uncomment/unfollow triggers not tested (expected to work)
2. **30-day cutoff** - Not verified (need old data to test)

### ‚ùå Not Tested (Low Priority)
1. **Swipe-to-delete** - Implemented but not tested
2. **Pull-to-refresh** - Implemented but not tested
3. **Error states** - Retry button not tested

## SQL Test Queries

### Create Test Activities

```sql
-- Get your user ID
SELECT user_id, username FROM profiles WHERE username = 'YOUR_USERNAME';

-- Create like activity
INSERT INTO likes (post_id, user_id)
VALUES (
    (SELECT id FROM posts WHERE author = 'YOUR_USER_ID' LIMIT 1),
    (SELECT user_id FROM profiles WHERE username != 'YOUR_USERNAME' LIMIT 1)
);

-- Create comment activity
INSERT INTO comments (post_id, user_id, body)
VALUES (
    (SELECT id FROM posts WHERE author = 'YOUR_USER_ID' LIMIT 1),
    (SELECT user_id FROM profiles WHERE username != 'YOUR_USERNAME' LIMIT 1),
    'Great photo! üî•'
);

-- Create follow activity
INSERT INTO follows (follower, followee)
VALUES (
    (SELECT user_id FROM profiles WHERE username != 'YOUR_USERNAME' LIMIT 1),
    'YOUR_USER_ID'
);

-- Create grouped likes (3 likes on same post)
INSERT INTO likes (post_id, user_id)
SELECT
    (SELECT id FROM posts WHERE author = 'YOUR_USER_ID' LIMIT 1),
    user_id
FROM profiles
WHERE username != 'YOUR_USERNAME'
LIMIT 3;
```

### Verify Activities

```sql
-- Check activities were created
SELECT
    a.activity_type,
    p.username as actor,
    a.is_read,
    a.created_at
FROM activities a
JOIN profiles p ON a.actor_id = p.user_id
WHERE a.user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
ORDER BY a.created_at DESC;

-- Check unread count
SELECT COUNT(*) as unread_count
FROM activities
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID' AND is_read = false;
```

### Cleanup Test Data

```sql
-- Delete all test activities
DELETE FROM activities WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
```

---

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### High Priority
1. **Post Navigation** - Tap like/comment ‚Üí view the post
2. **Comment Body** - Show actual comment text (not "...")
3. **Post Thumbnails** - Show small image preview for like/comment activities
4. **Activity Images** - Actor avatars (currently using placeholder)

### Medium Priority
5. **Infinite Scroll** - Load older activities on scroll
6. **Filter/Tabs** - Filter by activity type (All/Likes/Comments/Follows)
7. **Batch Operations** - "Clear all" button
8. **Custom Time Range** - Allow viewing older than 30 days

### Low Priority
9. **Activity Detail** - Tap activity ‚Üí see more context
10. **Mentions in Comments** - Notify when mentioned in comment
11. **Comment Replies** - Nested comment notifications
12. **Post Caption Preview** - Show post caption for context

---

## Migration History

**Applied Migrations:**
1. `create_activities_table` - Initial table with indexes and RLS
2. `create_activity_triggers` - Auto-create activities on like/comment/follow
3. `fix_activity_trigger_security` - Added `SET search_path = public` for security
4. `fix_activities_timestamp_format` - Changed created_at to TIMESTAMPTZ

---

## Important Learnings

### 1. TIMESTAMPTZ vs TIMESTAMP
**Problem:** Supabase returns ISO8601 with timezone info, but TIMESTAMP doesn't include timezone.
**Solution:** Always use TIMESTAMPTZ for proper date decoding.
**Error if wrong:** `Expected date string to be ISO8601-formatted... Got: 2025-10-26T12:59:43.377534`

### 2. Nested NavigationStack
**Problem:** Child views creating their own NavigationStack breaks navigation.
**Solution:** Conditionally create NavigationStack only at root level.
**Pattern:**
```swift
var body: some View {
    Group {
        if isRoot {
            NavigationStack { content }
        } else {
            content
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Badge Type Inference
**Problem:** `.badge(count > 0 ? count : nil)` fails type inference.
**Solution:** Use `Text` type for both branches: `.badge(count > 0 ? Text("\(count)") : Text(""))`

### 4. Grouped Activity Mark-as-Read
**Problem:** Only marking first activity in group.
**Solution:** Iterate through all activities in `GroupedActivityItem.activities` array.

### 5. Database Trigger Security
**Problem:** Security advisor warnings about mutable search_path.
**Solution:** Add `SET search_path = public` to all trigger functions.
